## ⚡ Overview

Press Your Luck (PYL) is a triangular scoring system built for air hockey tournaments and group night mayhem.  
Players take turns on offense, facing defenders one at a time. After each goal?  
You can cash out your points or... PRESS YOUR LUCK.

One miss? You lose everything that round.  
Resign early? You lock your score — but were you a coward or a genius?
